at 5:30pm.

# 16 June 2017

We will be having a small ceremony on this date from 1-2pm
at the San Francisco City Hall. Unfortunately, the space
is small and we will only be inviting close family to
this event. *Note* - All will need to pass through a metal
detector to enter City Hall. Please plan accordingly.

Informally, we will be going to a bar to be named later
in San Francisco at 9pm. We invite all of our guests to
attend if they would like.
