<p><img src="images/green_dress" alt="green_dress" /></p>

<p>Jess and Greg met in 2012 while they were both
enrolled in a Master’s program at Saint Joseph’s
University. They were studying biology but it was
<em>really</em> all about chemistry from the start. They
enjoyed walking together in the
<a href="http://www.fow.org">Wissahickon Park</a> and touring
breweries all around PA. Our favorites include
<a href="http://www.philadelphiabrewing.com">PBC</a>,
<a href="http://www.yardsbrewing.com">Yards</a>, and
<a href="http://www.troegs.com">Troegs</a>.</p>

<h2 id="act-ii">Act II.</h2>

<p>Jess completed her M.S. in 2013 and began working
at a Biotech company while Greg was finishing up
his degree. If you have ever driven on route 76
during rush hour, then you know that the commute was
brutal. Nevertheless, when Greg finished in 2014,
and after a short two week stint working as an
overqualified shelf stocker at Office Depot, he
began working at the same company with Jess. With a
carpool, the commute <em>instantly</em> became less
dreadful. They even read the entire Dostoevsky novel
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_House_of_the_Dead_(novel)">The House of the Dead</a> 
aloud that summer while sitting in traffic. At
least their time was better than rotting in a Siberian
prison.</p>

<h2 id="act-iii">Act III.</h2>

<p>Greg accepted an offer from Dartmouth College and
enrolled in a computational genetics program in
the Summer of 2014. They both quit their jobs and
moved to the beautiful <a href="http://www.uppervalleynhvt.com">Upper Valley</a>.
Jess found work as a Lab Manager in the Geisel School of
Medicine (literally 
<a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2012/04/05/150074545/seuss-medical-school-seuss-medical-school">named after Dr. Seuss</a>)
while Greg took courses and searched for a lab to join.
They reveled in the Vermont and New Hampshire beer scene,
which included regular trips to
<a href="https://www.harpoonbrewery.com/breweries/windsor">Harpoon</a> and
<a href="http://www.longtrail.com">Long Trail</a> and the occasional treat of
<a href="https://www.alchemistbeer.com">The Alchemist</a>,
<a href="http://www.hillfarmstead.com">Hill Farmstead</a>, and 
<a href="https://www.smuttynose.com">Smuttynose</a>. There was also
plenty of cross country skiing and hiking of the many
mountains in the area.</p>

<h2 id="act-iv">Act IV.</h2>

<p>Unfortunately, the Dartmouth medical school was having
<a href="http://www.dartblog.com/data/2015/09/012240.php">financial difficulties</a>,
which caused several prominent faculty members to transfer
to different institutions. Greg had recently joined one of those
labs and, after several long discussions, Greg and Jess
decided, in August 2015, to transfer as well. This decision
brought them back to Philly and to The University of
Pennsylvania, where Greg continued his genomics and
computational biology Ph.D. and Jess began working as
a scientist in the Department of Pathology studying
neurodegenerative diseases.  They discovered new
breweries this time around including
<a href="https://www.dockstreetbeer.com">Dock Street</a> and
<a href="http://www.crimeandpunishmentbrewingco.com">Crime &amp; Punishment</a>.
They also got a cat (named Myshkin), got
engaged, and Jess started a Computer Science Masters
at Penn while working full time along the way.</p>

<h2 id="act-v">Act V.</h2>

<p>The next stage in their life together will begin on
June 16-17, 2017 and they would be honored to celebrate
this new beginning with you.</p>
